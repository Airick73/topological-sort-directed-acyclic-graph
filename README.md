# topological_sort_directed_acyclic_graph
This program takes in a text file in a specific format represeting a directed graph and returns the the verticies topologically sorted or throws an expection if a cycle was detected. 

Input file:
The input graph is described in edge list format. The first line of the file has the number of vertices
and edges of the graph, separated by a space (n and m, respectively).
The following m lines have two nonnegative integers each. These integers, u and v, will be in
the range 0 to n âˆ’ 1, and they represent the endpoints of an edge in the graph. Specifically, they
represent an edge from u to v.

To run this program:
g++ digraph.cpp digraph.h driver.cpp
